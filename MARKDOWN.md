# Learnings and confusions

## Learnings.
*Things I learned about the course were concepts and tools of GitHub that I did not 
know even though some of them I had already used, which are the repositories, cloning, 
commits and pushings, and the forks, issues and pull request are tools that I did not 
know and I found quite useful and interesting that I will surely use in the future.*

## Confusions.
Everything that comes in the GitHub course is quite clear, so I had no confusion.
